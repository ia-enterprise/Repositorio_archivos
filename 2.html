<h1>Adverbs of Manner </h1>
</br>
<p>An adverb of manner will explain how an action is carried out. Very often adverbs of manner are adjectives with -ly added to the end, but this is certainly not always the case. In fact, some adverbs of manner will have the same spelling as the adjective form.</p>

</br>
<p>Some examples of adverbs of manner include:</p>
1.  Slowly</p>
2.  Rapidly</p>
3.  Clumsily</p>
4.  Badly</p>
5.  Diligently</p>
6.  Sweetly</p>
7.  Warmly</p>
8.  Sadly</p>


</br>
Adverb of manner examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
</br>
• She passed the exam easily.</p>
• They walk quickly to catch the train.</p>
• The dinner party went badly.</p>
• John answered the question correctly.</p>
</br>

Notice how the adjectives are formed by adding -ly to the adjectives bad, correct and quick, although there is a slight spelling change when forming an adverb with the adjective easy.</p>
</br>

As mentioned, some adverbs of manner take the same spelling as the adjective and never add an -ly to the end:</p>
</br>

• The boys had worked hard.</p>
• The car drives</p>
• Julia dances well.</p>
</br>

<h1>Adverbs of place</h1>
</br>
An adverb of place, sometimes called spatial adverbs, will help explain where an action happens. Adverbs of place will be associated with the action of the verb in a sentence, providing context for direction, distance and position: southeast, everywhere, up, left, close by, back, inside, around. These terms don’t usually end in -ly. Adverbs of place examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
</br>


<h1>Directions</h1>
</br>
• New York is located north of Philadelphia.</p>
• They traveled down the mountainside.</p>
• First, I looked here, and then I looked there, but I can’t find them anywhere.</p>
</br>

Notice that here and there are often used at the beginning of a sentence to express emphasis or in exclamation.</p>
</br>
• Here comes the sun.</p>
• There is love in the air.</p>
• Here you are!</p>
</br>

Many times, adverbs of place can be used as prepositions as well. The difference is, when the phrase is used as an adverb, it is modifying a verb; when it is used as a preposition, it is always followed by a noun.</p>
</br>
• New York is located north of Philadelphia -> New York is on the map.</p>
• They travelled down river -> They travelled in the first compartment.</p>
• That puppy was walking around by itself-> We put a collar around its neck.</p>
</br>


<h1>Distance</h1>
</br>
• There was a deli</p>
• Jane is moving far away.</p>
• Carly is sitting close to me</p>.
</br>

<h1>Position</h1>
</br>
• The treasure lies underneath the box.</p>
• The cat is sleeping on the bed.</p>
• Why are you standing in the middle of the dancefloor?</p>


In addition, some adverbs of position will refer to a direction of movement. These often end in -ward or -wards.</p>
</br>
• Oscar travelled onward to Los Angeles.</p>
• Hannah looked upwards to the heavens.</p>
• Molly, move forward to the front of the queue, please.</p>
 </br>


<h1>Adverbs of Frequency</h1>
</br>
Adverbs of frequency are used to express time or how often something occurs. Adverbs of frequency can be split two main groups. The first, adverbs of indefinite frequency, are terms that have an unclear meaning as to how long are how often something occurs: usually, always, normally. These adverbs will usually be placed after the main verb or between the auxiliary verb and infinitive. Adverbs of frequency examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>

</br>
• The adverb is usually placed before the main verb.</p>
• I can normally make the shot.</p>
• I will always love</p>
</br>

Adverbs of definite frequency will usually be placed at the end of the sentence.</p>
</br>
• We get paid hourly.</p>
• I come here</p>
• The situation seems to change monthly.</p>
• The newspaper is bought daily.</p>

</br>
<h1>Adverbs of Time</h1>
</br>
Adverbs of time, while seemingly similar to adverbs of frequency, tell us when something happens. Adverbs of time are usually placed at the end of a sentence.</p>
Adverbs of time examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
</br>

• I will see you</p>
• Harvey forgot his lunch yesterday and again today.</p>
• I have to go now.</p>
• We first met Julie last year.</p>
</br>

While it’s almost always correct to have the adverb of time at the end of the sentence, you can place it at the start of the sentence to put a different emphasis on the time if it is important to the context.</p>
</br>

• Last year was the worst year of my life.</p>
• Tomorrow our fate will be sealed.</p>
• Yesterday my troubles seemed so far away.</p>
</br>

<h1>Adverbs of Purpose</h1>

</br>
Adverbs of purpose, sometimes called adverbs of reason, help to describe why something happened. They can come in the form of individual words – so, since, thus, because – but also clauses – so that, in order to. Notice in the examples that the adverbs of purpose are used to connect sentences that wouldn’t make sense if they were formed alone.</p>

</br>
Adverbs of purpose examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
</br>
• I was sick, thus didn’t go to work today.</p>
• I started jogging so that I wouldn’t be late.</p>
• Because I was late, I jogged a little faster.</p>
• Since it’s your birthday, I will buy you a gift.</p>

</br>
<h1>Positions of Adverbs</h1>
</br>
The positions of adverbs are not a fixed or set thing. As you have seen, adverbs can appear in different position in a sentence. However, there are some rules that help us decide where an adverb should be positioned. The rules will be different depending on whether the adverb is acting to modify an adjective or another adverb, a verb or what type of adverb it is.</p>
</br>

Positional adverb examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification. Adverb position with adjectives and other adverbs</p>
</br>

</br>
These adverbs will usually be placed before the adjective or adverb being modified:</p>
</br>
• We gave them a really tough match. The adverb really modifies the adjective tough.</p>
• It was quite windy that night. The adverb quite modifies the adjective windy.</p>
• We don’t go to the movies terribly often. The adverb terribly modifies the adverb often.</p>
</br>

<h1>Adverb position with verbs</h1>
</br>
This can be a bit trickier because, it will depend on the type of adverb – place, position, time etc. – and there are many exceptions to the rules. However, a basic set of guidelines is shown below. Adverbs of manner or place are usually positioned at the end of the sentence:</p>

</br>
• She laughed timidly. </p>
• I stroked the cat gently.</p>
• Janine lived here. </p>
• There is money everywhere.</p>
</br>

As mentioned, if the adverb is of definite time it will be placed at the end of the sentence.</p>
</br>
• I did it yesterday.</p>
• We can discuss it tomorrow.</p>
• Let’s go to Paris next week.</p>


</br>
However, if it is an indefinite period of time, it will go between the subject and main verb.</p>
</br>
• We often go to Paris in the springtime.</p>
• Debbie regularly swims here.</p>
• Bobby and Audrey always loved fishing by the lake.</p>

</br>
<h1>Order of Adverbs</h1>

</br>
Adverb order is so important it has clear rules. It’s already mentioned that some adverbs will act to modify another, but how do you decide the structure of a sentence with several adverbs? Thankfully, there is a simple set of rules to follow, called the order of adverbs. Handily, the order of adverbs, sometimes also called the royal order of adverbs, can help us determine sentence structure too. In short, the adverbs get preference (are placed first) in the following order:</p>

</br>
1.  Adverbs of manner.</p>
2.  Adverbs of place.</p>
3.  Adverbs of frequency.</p>
4.  Adverbs of time.</p>
5.  Adverbs of purpose.</p>

</br>
Consider this sentence:</p>

</br>
I run (verb) quickly (manner) down the road (place) every morning (frequency) before school (time) because (purpose) I might miss the bus.</p>

</br>
While it is good to remember the order of adverbs, there is always flexibility with language, and we have already mentioned that adverbs of time and frequency can be placed at the start of a sentence to change the emphasis. So, bottom line: think of the order of adverbs as more of a guideline than a rule that can’t be broken.</p>
