                   Recognizing prepositions can be challenging as they do not always follow a consistent pattern in terms of their position in a sentence, nor do they have a discernible structure or spelling. We do know, however, that prepositions are almost always short words, with the majority having less than six letters. One technique people use to identify a preposition is to think of a preposition as anywhere a mouse can go. Above, below, next to, between, beyond, through, by, with…It won’t cover them all, but it can be a useful question to ask when trying to identify and recognize a preposition. While there are over 100 prepositions, there are around 500,00-700,000 nouns in English! It is unlikely anyone will learn so many nouns, but recognizing and then mastering prepositions might be a worthwhile and attainable goal.</p>
                 </br>
<h1>Prepositions with Nouns</h1>
<p>There are lots of different nouns that carry specific prepositions to consolidate their meaning. These are called dependent prepositions. Again, there isn’t a set rule that says a particular type of noun will take a dependent preposition, although they normally follow the noun. Moreover, there are many possible combinations. Essentially, it’s case of familiarizing yourself with the different possibilities of nouns and dependent prepositions. Examples:</p>

</br>
<p>• He displayed cruelty towards his dog.</p>
<p>• She had knowledge of physics.</p>
<p>• The trouble with Jack.</p>
<p>• 21 is the age at which you are allowed to drink.</p>
<p>• Bolt made another attempt at the world record.</p>
<p>• The police held an inquiry into the murder.</p>

</br>
<h1>Prepositions with Verbs</h1>

<p>Prepositional verbs – the phrasal combinations of verbs and prepositions – are important parts of speech. The prepositions again act as links between the verb and noun or gerund, giving extra meaning to the sentence. The prepositions most commonly used with verbs are: to, for, about, of, in, at and from. The good news is that these will always come after the verb in the sentence. However, it should also be noted that the prepositional verbs can have slightly different meaning compared to the original verb. For example, to relate a story simply means to tell a story, to relate to a story means you identify with it, find some personally meaning in that story.</p>
</br>

<p>Verb + to:</p>
<p>• He admitted to the charge.</p>
<p>• I go to Vancouver on vacation twice a year.</p>
<p>• William can relate to the character in the play.</p>

</br>
<p>Verb + for:</p>
<p>• He must apologize for his actions.</p>
<p>• We searched for ages before we found the perfect apartment.</p>
<p>• I provide for my family by working two jobs.</p>

</br>
<p>Verb + with:</p>
<p>• I don’t agree with your claim.</p>
<p>• The lawyer said he will meet with your representatives.</p>
<p>• They began with a quick warm-up.</p>

</br>
<p>Verb + of:</p>
<p>• I dream of a better life.</p>
<p>• Have you heard of Shakespeare?</p>
<p>• The bread consists of dough, raisins and a little honey.</p>
</br>

<p>Verb + in:</p>
<p>• Does Rick believe in miracles?</p>
<p>• Fallon lives in New York.</p>
<p>• The bus accident resulted in my being late to work.</p>

</br>
<p>Verb + at</p>
<p>1.  We arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>2.  Ilene excels at singing.</p>
<p>3.  Will the baby smile at her mother?</p>
</br>

<p>Verb + on:</p>
<p>• We should really concentrate on our studies now.</p>
<p>• Helen insisted on Brenda’s company.</p>
<p>• Morris experimented on some canvas.</p>
</br>

<p>Verb + from:</p>
<p>• Since turning 80, she suffers from lapses in concentration.</p>
<p>• Dad retired from the navy in the 1970s.</p>
<p>• Billy Bob, please refrain from doing that.</p>
 </br>
<h1>Prepositions with Adjectives </h1>

<p>Prepositions can form phrases with adjectives to give further context to the action, emotion or thing the adjective is describing. Like verbs and nouns, adjectives can be followed by: to, about, In, for, with, at and by.</p>
</br>

<p>• Ellie is crazy about this movie.</p>
<p>• Michelle is interested in politics.</p>
<p>• We are sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>• Jane will be delighted with her results.</p>
<p>• Is he still angry at the world?</p>
<p>• The entire room was astonished by the election results.</p>

</br>
<p>There can sometimes be a pattern in deciding which prepositions go with adjectives, for example, when adjectives have the same or very similar meaning to each other, they might take the same preposition:</p>

</br>
<p>• Frightened of, afraid of, scared of, terrified of</p>
Indeed, when adjectives have opposite meaning they might also take the same preposition:</p>
<p>• Good at, great at, superb at, wonderful at</p>
<p>• Bad at, terrible at, woeful at, inept at</p>
</br>
There are always many exceptions to the above, but it can help that there seems to be some
consistency when adjectives have the same meaning or opposite meaning.</p>
 </br>
<p>Nevertheless, perhaps a more general rule is that English speakers simply need to learn which prepositions go with which adjectives, as meaning can change significantly by using a different preposition.</p>
</br>

<p>• I am good at sports means I have some athletic talent.</p>
<p>• The nurse was good to my mother means she took care of her and was nice, kind, and helpful.</p>
<p>• I am good with animals means I get along with them and handle them well</p>
<p>• Swimming is good for your health.</p>
<p>• That was good of you to come means you were begin nice and good to visit.</p>
<p>• My little brother is good inside (his body) means even though you can’t see how he thinks and feels, he is good. Even if his behavior is bad.</p>
<p>• The blueberry jam will be good on toast. </p>
